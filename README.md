# Vehicle Detection and Tracking

The complete implementation for this project lies within the [project notebook](vehicle-detection-and-tracking.ipynb). A read-only version can be seen within the [project html notebook](vehicle-detection-and-tracking.html)

In order to be able to execute the notebook file, you need to download and extract the car and non-car data within the respective folders (i.e.):

    * Kitti and GTI data : ./vehicles (default extraction directory)
    * Udacity Data: object_dataset (default extraction directory)
    * etc
